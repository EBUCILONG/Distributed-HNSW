[Husky](http://www.husky-project.com/) is a distributed computing system designed to handle mixed jobs of coarse-grained transformations, graph computing and machine learning. The core of Husky is written in C++ so as to leverage the performance of native runtime. For machine learning, Husky supports relaxed consistency level and asynchronous computing in order to exploit higher network/CPU throughput.

For more details about Husky, please check our [Wiki](https://github.com/husky-team/husky/wiki).

For bugs in Husky, please file an issue on [github issue platform](https://github.com/husky-team/husky/issues).

For further discussions, please send email to *support@husky-project.com*.

Dependencies
-------------

Husky has the following minimal dependencies:

* CMake (Version >= 3.0.2, if >= 3.6.0, it should set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` first when occurring errors to find the following dependencies)
* ZeroMQ (including both [libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq) and [cppzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq))
* Boost (Version >= 1.58)
* A working C++ compiler (clang/gcc Version >= 4.9/icc/MSVC)
* TCMalloc (In [gperftools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools))
* [GLOG](https://github.com/google/glog) (Latest version, it will be included automatically)

Some optional dependencies:

* libhdfs3 [C/C++ HDFS Client](https://github.com/Pivotal-Data-Attic/pivotalrd-libhdfs3)
* MongoDB C++ Driver (Version [legacy 1.1.2](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/tree/legacy))

Build
-----

Download the latest source code of Husky:

    $ git clone https://github.com/husky-team/husky.git

Or download latest release in [Releases Notes](https://github.com/husky-team/husky/releases).

We assume the root directory of Husky is `$HUSKY_ROOT`. Go to `$HUSKY_ROOT` and do a out-of-source build using CMake:

    $ cd $HUSKY_ROOT
    $ mkdir release
    $ cd release
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..  # CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo
    $ make help                            # List all build target
    $ make -j{N} Master                    # Build the Husky master
    $ make $ApplicationName                # Build the Husky application

It is available to compile static or shared library for those projects based on Husky.

    $ make -j{N} husky                     # Build static library for default
    $ cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY
    $ make -j{N} husky-shared              # Build shared library

By the way, we provide a docker of Husky, which have already installed the dependencies. Try it in [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/huskyteam/).

Configuration
-------------

Husky is supposed to run on any platform. Configurations can be stored in a configure file (INI format) or can be the command arguments when running Husky. An example file for configuration is like the following:

    # Required
    master_host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    master_port=yyyyy
    comm_port=yyyyy

    # Optional
    log_dir=path/to/log
    hdfs_namenode=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    hdfs_namenode_port=yyyyy

    # For Master
    serve=1

    # Session for worker information
    [worker]
    info=master:3


For single-machine environment, use the hostname of the machine as both the master and the (only) worker.

For distributed environment, first copy and modify `$HUSKY_ROOT/scripts/exec.sh` according to actual configuration. `scripts/exec.sh` depends on `pssh`.

Run a Husky Program
--------------------

Run `./Master --help` for helps. Check the examples in `examples` directory.

First make sure that the master is running. Use the following to start the master

    $ ./Master --conf /path/to/your/conf

In the single-machine environment, use the following,

    $ ./<executable> --conf /path/to/your/conf

In the distributed environment, use the following to execute workers on all machines,

    $ cp $HUSKY_ROOT/scripts/exec.sh .
    $ ./exec.sh <executable> --conf /path/to/your/conf

If MPI has been installed in the distributed environment, you may use the following alternatively,

    $ cp $HUSKY_ROOT/scripts/mpi-exec.sh .
    $ ./mpi-exec.sh <executable> --conf /path/to/your/conf

Run Husky Unit Test
--------------------

Husky provides a set unit tests (based on [gtest 1.7.0](https://github.com/google/googletest)) in `core/`. Run it with:

    $ make HuskyUnitTest
    $ ./HuskyUnitTest

Documentation
---------------

Do the following to generate API documentation,

    $ doxygen doxygen.config

Or use the provided script,

    $ ./scripts/doxygen.py --gen

Then go to `html/` for HTML documentation, and `latex/` for LaTeX documentation

Start a http server to view the documentation by browser,

    $ ./scripts/doxygen.py --server
